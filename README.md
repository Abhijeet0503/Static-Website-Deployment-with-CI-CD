What I Did:


In this project, I set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to deploy a static website using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, S3, and CloudFront. The pipeline is connected to a GitHub repository as the source, so every code change is automatically built and deployed to the website. I enabled versioning on the S3 bucket to track changes and used CloudFront to distribute the website globally for faster performance. This project demonstrates hands-on experience in AWS deployment automation, static website hosting, and continuous delivery workflows.
